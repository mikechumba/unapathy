          <h3>NYS Scandal</h3>
          <p>The Kenyan Parliamentary Accounts Committee found that the Devolution ministry, where she served as a Cabinet Secretary, spent KSh450,000 ($4500) for 18 custom-made condom dispensers. The ministry's asset register also revealed Sh1.7
            million ($17000) was spent for an HD television set in Anne Waiguru's office and Sh12 million ($120000) for an office partition, in the 2013/2014 financial year. The register, presented by the ministry's Principal Secretary Peter
            Mangiti, listed purchase of a copier at Sh1.5 million ($15000), while Sh1.9million ($19000) was spent for free downloadable Adobe software and Sh250,000 ($2500) for ten flashdisks/memory sticks. These prices were so ridiculous and so
            highly inflated that they sparked uproar in political quarters and among the Kenyan public. Headlines around the world, including those such as "sex toys listed among state assets" appeared, putting the spotlight on the unraveling
            scandal.</p>
