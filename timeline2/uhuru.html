          <h3>2nd Term as President</h3>
          <p>General elections were held in Kenya on 8 August 2017 to elect the President, members of Parliament and devolved governments. The reported results indicated that incumbent President Uhuru Kenyatta was re-elected with 54% of the vote.
            His main opponent, Raila Odinga, refused to accept the results and contested them in the Supreme Court.
            The results of the presidential election were subsequently annulled and fresh elections were ordered to be held within 60 days. It was later announced that a new election would be held on October 17. However, the results of the
            parliamentary and local elections remained valid. The date for the presidential election was later changed to 26 October 2017. Despite the ruling for a new Presidential election, Odinga later announced his decision to withdraw from the
            repeat election on October 10.</p>

          <p>The ICC charges did not discourage him from once again aiming for the presidency. In April 2012, he left KANU and the following month, he launched a new party, The National Alliance (TNA). Later that year, he and TNA became part of a
            multiparty alliance known as the ‘Jubilee Coalition’.</p>

            Finance but remained on his post as Deputy Prime Minister, which he retained until becoming the president of Kenya.</p>

            from January 2003 to December 2007.</p>
