        <h1>Bio</h1>
        <p>Uhuru Muigai Kenyatta (born 26 October 1961) is a Kenyan politician and businessman who is the fourth and current President of the Republic of Kenya.[1] He served as the Member of Parliament (MP) for Gatundu South from 2002 to 2013. Currently the party leader and a member of the Jubilee Party of Kenya, he was previously involved with The National Alliance and before that the Kenya African National Union.</p>
        <p>He is the son of Jomo Kenyatta, Kenya's first President, and his fourth wife Mama Ngina Kenyatta.[2] Uhuru was re-elected for a second term in the August 2017 general election, winning 54% of the popular vote.[3][4] The win was formally declared on national television by the Chairman of the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission Wafula Chebukati.[5][6] However, Uhuru's election was successfully challenged in the Supreme Court of Kenya by his main competitor, Raila Odinga. On 1 September 2017, the court declared the election invalid and ordered a new presidential election to take place within 60 days from the day of the ruling. A new presidential election was held on 26 October, which he won, with 39% participation due to voter fatigue, voter apathy and being boycotted by the opposition.</p>

          <h3>2nd Term as President</h3>
          <p>General elections were held in Kenya on 8 August 2017 to elect the President, members of Parliament and devolved governments. The reported results indicated that incumbent President Uhuru Kenyatta was re-elected with 54% of the vote.
            His main opponent, Raila Odinga, refused to accept the results and contested them in the Supreme Court.
            The results of the presidential election were subsequently annulled and fresh elections were ordered to be held within 60 days. It was later announced that a new election would be held on October 17. However, the results of the
            parliamentary and local elections remained valid. The date for the presidential election was later changed to 26 October 2017. Despite the ruling for a new Presidential election, Odinga later announced his decision to withdraw from the
            repeat election on October 10.</p>
