      <h1>Terms and Conditions</h1>
      <p>Please read the terms and conditions carefully before use of our website. By accessing the Unapathy website you agree to be bound by these terms and conditions.</p>
      <h3>Abuse of Data</h3>
      <p>Unapathy is a consolidation site that does not curate its own news, articles, videos or any content found on this site. As our name infers, (un-apathy) we are trying to cultivate a culture that’s opposite to the lack of interest,
        enthusiasm, or concern (apathy) shown by Kenyans towards our representatives.We only compile data from across the web and verify it through reliable sources namely the office of the Auditor general and Africacheck only.(Africacheck is non-partisan fact checking group established in June 2012 with the stated aim of
        improving news gathering in Africa.</p>
      <p>We therefore CANNOT and WILL NOT be held liable for any damages arising form the printing, viewing, dissemination or alteration of data from our site.</p>
      <h3>Innacurate Data</h3>
      <p>As previously stated, we are only responsible for the consolidation and dissemination of information and DO NOT curate any news, articles, videos or any content found on this site.We do, however thoroughly vet all the information shown on our site for validity and accuracy. If (even though HIGHLY unlikely) we release any data that is lacking in authenticity & || accuracy, we would kindly ask for your feedback and we will look into it.</p>
      <p>We take libel and defamation very seriously and would not be party to dissemination of any data that is not fact by our own volition. Our goal is to inform the Kenyan people of the facts to empower them and providing information on representatives is one way of having an engaged citizenry. The ultimate goal is to see citizens hold their representatives accountable based on their actions or inaction.. We will therefore neither allow ourselves to be used as a tool to target anyone nor use the platform as a tool for such purposes.</p>
      <p>Service is our earnest endeavour and we serve with our hearts both strong and true.</p>
