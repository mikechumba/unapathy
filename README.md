# Unapathy - Politician Tracker

## Project Description

This project is a collaborative effort at providing real information on Kenyan Politicians. Ideally, the initial scope of the project would have provided information on all the extant Kenyan politicians and representatives. However, limited resources in terms of time and money only allows a scaled-down scope of the project. As such, the project now provides a web-based hub for information on six select representatives from the Kenyan political sphere. These representatives are:
1. Uhuru Kenyatta
2. William Samoei Ruto
3. Anne Waiguru
4. Mike Mbuvi "Sonko" Kioko
5. Aden Duale
6. Martha Karua

Information regarding the above-mentioned politicians include, but is not limited to;
* Age
* Marital status
* Family
* Current political positions
* Their political philosophies and history, and
* A timeline of their achievements and controversies over the years

## Behavior Driven Development

  As with any other reputable development project, Unapathy followed a systematic process between its conceptualization stage and its actual implementation. First, it was considered that users needed to perform certain tasks. However, due to the aforementioned dilution of the initial scope of the program, the program has limited functionalities. However, this is not to mean that it lacks in resourcefulness. As per the initial Minimum Viable Product, the following specifications are expected of the website.

###  Minimum Viable Product
1. People can access and view profiles of representatives.
2. List representatives with profiles on our site.
3. Provide detailed summaries of representativesâ€™ track record.
